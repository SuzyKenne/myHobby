                <strong>Traveling</strong> may not seem like the best hobby to include on your resume at first sight. After all, it simply involves picking a destination and being a tourist, right? 
    
                Well, not exactly. 
    
                Someone who loves traveling is also likely to be: 
    
                Curious to learn new things, experience new cultures, and meet new people
                Well-organized and adaptable to new situations and people
                Not afraid to step out of their comfort zone
                All of these personality traits make for an adaptable and flexible employee, something that employers appreciate!
