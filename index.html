                 <strong>Coding</strong>, also known as programming, is the process of creating instructions for a computer to follow.
                 It involves writing lines of code using a programming language to tell the computer what tasks to perform.
                 By writing these instructions, or code, programmers can create software applications, websites, mobile apps, and much more.

                 Coding is a creative and logical process that requires problem-solving skills.<br/>
                 Programmers use programming languages like <em> Python, JavaScript, Java, C++</em>, and many others to communicate with computers.
                 They write algorithms, design data structures, and implement logical operations to build functional and efficient programs.

                 Through coding, programmers can create a wide range of applications and solutions that can automate tasks, manipulate data, provide interactive experiences, and solve complex problems.
                 It is a powerful tool that enables individuals to bring their ideas to life in the digital world.
